Running
------
The production site runs on **port 80**.

1. From the project root, execute:
   
   $ `npm run build && npm run server`

2. Go to http://[hostname]:80.

*NB: I haven't actually done any work to set up the Webpack build for production yet (AKA there's something weird with the CSS, the JavaScript bundle is huge... and other delights I'm sure).*


Developing
------
To use Webpack in development you need to run two servers:

The Webpack dev server runs on **port 8080, _and that is where the site will be available while developing_**.  
The Express/Socket.IO server runs on 8081. 

1. From the project root, execute:

   $ `npm run server`  
   $ `npm run dev-client`

2. Go to http://[hostname]:8080.
